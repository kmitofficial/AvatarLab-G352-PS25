**PURPOSE OF PROJECT**

The purpose of this project is to develop an AI-powered talking head video generation system that can take text input and a reference image to produce a realistic, lip-synced video of a virtual avatar speaking the given text. By integrating SMALL-E for speech synthesis and DiffTalk for facial animation, the system aims to create high-quality, natural-looking AI avatars capable of expressing emotions and mimicking human speech patterns.


**APPLICATIONS OF THE PROJECT**
This project has broad applications across multiple industries:

1️⃣ **Virtual Assistants & AI Avatars** – Interactive customer support agents, AI news anchors.
2️⃣ **E-Learning & Education** – AI tutors for online courses and language learning.
3️⃣ **Marketing & Advertisement** – AI spokespersons for product demos and promotions.
4️⃣ **Content Creation & Social Media** – AI-generated YouTube/TikTok influencers.
5️⃣ **Accessibility & Assistive Tech** – Lip-synced videos for the hearing impaired.
6️⃣ **Gaming & Virtual Reality (VR)** – AI-driven NPCs in interactive experiences.
7️⃣ **Corporate Training** – AI avatars for employee training and company announcements.
8️⃣ **Film & Animation** – Automated voice-over and character animation.

### Steps:
1. **User Input:** The user enters a script in the web interface.
2. **API Processing:** The text input is sent to the backend API.
3. **Speech Synthesis (Small-E)**: The text is converted into natural speech.
4. **Facial Animation (DiffTalk)**: The avatar’s face is animated to match the speech.
5. **Rendering & Output**: The final video is generated and displayed to the user.
6. **Download & Share**: Users can download the generated avatar video or share it directly.
