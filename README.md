# AvatarLab-G352-PS25

Welcome to Avatar Lab, where AI meets lifelike avatar animation. Unlike conventional talking avatar generators, Avatar Lab goes beyond simple lip-syncingâ€”it integrates advanced deep learning models to create highly expressive, emotionally intelligent avatars that truly feel alive.

By leveraging Coqui TTS for speech synthesis and DiffPoseTalker for facial motion refinement, Avatar Lab delivers seamless, high-quality avatar animations that capture both voice and emotion in a truly immersive way.<br><br>


#  Why Avatar Lab?

Most AI avatar solutions focus on basic lip sync, but real human communication involves subtle head movements, nuanced facial expressions, and emotions that align with speech. Avatar Lab solves this with:

 â€¢ Neural Speech Synthesis â€“ Powered by Coqui TTS, generating natural, expressive voices.<br>
 â€¢ True-to-Life Lip Sync â€“ Using DiffPoseTalker to match lip movements with audio at a near-human level.<br>
 â€¢ Dynamic Facial Motion â€“ Head tilts, blinks, and micro-expressions make avatars feel authentic.<br>
 â€¢ REST API for Easy Integration â€“ Use Avatar Lab with any application, from gaming to education to AI assistants.<br>
 â€¢ Built for Developers & Creators â€“ MERN stack backend with scalable architecture for seamless integration.<br>
